# hello-world
this is my first attempt at using github.  Yay!
this is a commit.  tell a bit about myself?   i am the accelerate analytics admin.  and i am testing out github.  now i am continuing to write to test out the soft wrap capability.  thanks for reading.
i also like the example that starts with "Hello Humans"
Mostly because I like tacos too.   Earth tacos.  Not moon tacos.  But really, who doesn't like tacos?
